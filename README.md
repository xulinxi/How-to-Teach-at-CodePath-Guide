How to Teach at CodePath Guide (Mentor Summer 2022)
Mentors	Unit 2, 3, 4, & 8


Unit 2: Learning is built with justice in mind
üí¨ Reflect
‚óè	Part 1: What does Justice mean to you? How would you define it? 
I view justice of leveling the play field for everyone, no matter their backgrounds. For example, a student from a small school might have less resources and internship opportunities than a student from a top university (ex: Ivy schools) does. In CodePath, we are creating the same learning opportunities and internship opportunities for all students no matter their past, no matter their backgrounds.
‚óè	Part 2: What resonated with you from these articles? What questions do you still have?
After I read Automating NYC, I resonated with the idea of the bias in coding inequality. 1) Bias can be created from big data, such as a norm of using food stamp can be seen as a fraud. Therefore, enough supervision and different algorithms should be used for different scenarios. 2) Therefore, we cannot trust the data 100%. We also dig deeper behind what machine present to us. 
‚óè	Part 3: In the CodePath classroom, how will you reflect on your own cultural lens and create a welcoming and affirming environment?
I will respect and listen to my students‚Äô ideas, be understanding of their questions and try my best to resonate with them and to help them resolve their problems.
‚≠ê Assignment #2
1.	You are facilitating a group of 5 students, and 1 student never participates. You ask after class how you can help. The student shares that they are very far behind, and don't know how to keep up because everyone talks so fast. How would you structure the next session to support this student?
1)	I can design next session as a review session. 2) I will also recommend students to form study group outside after each class to reinforce their learning.

2.	A female-identifying student shares before class that they are frustrated with another male identifying student who always cuts them off when they are talking. In the next session, you observe the male identifying student interrupting the female identifying student. How would you support both students?
Although I won‚Äôt point out the male-identifying student‚Äôs name, I will reinforce the importance of respect for others. Everyone should have enough time to finish their opinion in the class. Please wait until after others finish first if you need to say something.
Unit 3: Learning is deeply empathetic and inclusive
üí¨ Reflect
‚óè	Part 1: How would you describe the Learning Zones model to students?
The Learning Zones can be viewed as learning situations: comfortable, growth/stretch, panic/uncomfortable. Within the comfort zone, a student might feel confident about the assignments and is able to complete these assignments. In the growth zone, students are able to learn new things and stretch their abilities to a higher level. In a panic zone, students might be facing more assignments they hadn‚Äôt seen before or have a sense of failing. Being at the edge of the growth zone and panic zone could help students with consistent learning and help them recognize the areas that they are not familiar with.

‚óè	Part 2: Which of these strategies were new to you? Which are you most committed to trying out?
The Emotional Cycle of Change was new to me. I didn‚Äôt know the valley of despair was always a part of the learning process. However, this stage of learning is critical for students because that‚Äôs the pivot point to help students notice their changes, which boosts their confidence in the fields they are learning.

‚óè	Part 3: As an Instructor at CodePath.org, how will you engage students in the Emotional Cycle of Change model?
I will share the Emotional Cycle of Change model with my students. I will also focus on the valley of despair and help them understand by achieving this stage of learning; they‚Äôve completed half of their learning journey. This stage is normal and appears in everyone‚Äôs learning cycle and helps them feel comfortable seeking out help. 
‚≠ê Assignment #3
1.	Choose 2 icebreaker games that you will commit to leading with your class within the first two weeks to help students get to know each other and feel more comfortable taking risks. Check out the Icebreakers section of the Activity Bank page for ideas, and feel free to bring your own games or ideas as well.
Done.
2.	Review the CodePath Community Agreements and practice explaining them and their importance out loud as if you were explaining to students.
Done.
‚è∞ 	We will be here and be present ‚è∞
	Actively build community & create an inclusive space
 	We will be curious and have a learning mindset
‚ùì	Ask for help when you need it ‚ùì
 	We will all have our cameras on 


Unit 4: We Cultivate Technical Excellence
üí¨ Reflect
‚óè	Part 1: Which of these Dysfunctional Illusions of Rigor felt familiar to you from your time as a student? Which are you most committed to reframing?
I felt familiar with the first Dysfunctional Illusions of Rigor (Hard courses weed out weak students). For example, an intro to biology course at my undergraduate school was a ‚Äúweed-out‚Äù course for all biology majors since my school has a strong Biology department. I remember my professor marked one of my two correct answers as a wrong answer because he told me that the question only asked me to select a ‚Äúone‚Äù answer. Therefore, even though there were two correct answers, I could only choose one answer. As the Learning Zones study shows, students will learn better when they are between stretch and panic zones. Putting students in a constant panic zone only for the sake of weeding out students is not a good way of teaching. Since every student has different strengths, backgrounds, and understanding, I am most committed to reframing this ‚Äúweed-out‚Äù style of teaching because I believe in teaching each student at his/her own pace instead of failing them using inappropriate pedagogy.

‚≠ê Assignment #4
1.	Write out your narrative of your career in a way that is shareable with students. The goal is that students can relate to your journey and gain some perspective on the industry that they might not have had before. We recommend this be ~5 min in length (a page or two of content). Tip: Be sure to highlight times when you overcame challenges, changed your mind, or learned an important lesson!

During the first semester of my high school, I had to drop my IT class. I have never dropped a class before. That was also my first semester at an American high school. The reason I had to drop that class was because I couldn‚Äôt understand the lecture. I tried to ask one of my classmates‚Äô notes, but he didn‚Äôt take any notes. I also asked my teachers for her PowerPoint slides, notes, or anything else I could make up for this course. She refused to share anything to me. Therefore, I had to drop that course. However, with my ESL teacher‚Äôs help, I was able to take an online IT class, which I finished within a month, at the end of the same semester. I scored an A in that online IT course. 
Even I got an A in computer course, I lost my interests in computer because of the bad experience with my IT course professor and all the cramming of book knowledge for that online course. I was pretty sure I would not take any computer science related course until I first started my first semester at college. I was invited by a female professor from my school‚Äôs computer science department for a short conversation. She told me that she noticed I passed my AP Calculus course, which indicated I have a good foundation in math, and she wanted to invite me to take an intro to programming course. She hoped to invite more female students to tech fields. 
Although my first thought was to turn down the invite, I still registered this programming course because I wanted to overcome my fear and challenge myself in college. Four years later, I was able to graduate with my CS degree. Therefore, I would never let any past failure to hold me back from future successes.

Unit 8: How to be successful in your role
‚≠ê Assignment #8
1.	It is now time for you to give us feedback, Please take 5min to complete this End of Course Survey, on the How to Teach at CodePath course module. Your feedback is important to us and we will consider all feedback for future improvements. Thank you in advance.

Done.
